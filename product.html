                            <p>On New Year’s, we traditionally organized a quest for the kids from Natasha. This time it was “The  Strange Story of Professor Wondermaker.” Since we celebrated with a big group, there were five kids, and we decided to split them into two teams.To even things out, we involved one adult as well. Accordingly, all the tasks were printed in duplicate (and placed into ifferent envelopes — white ones for one team, kraft ones for the other).The children happily dove right into the comic book — they had never seen anything like that in a quest before! Then they moved on to the tasks — some of them weren’t easy at all, there were even some spy-style listenings to check whether the other team had solved a challenge.It was exciting for everyone — from ages 10–17 and even 40+. They were absorbed for about an hour and a half, maybe more — time just flew by, and everyone was happy!Natasha, thank you for helping us create such a wonderful adventure for the kids with minimal effort!
